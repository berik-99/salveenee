# salveenee — Procedural Stream-of-Consciousness Simulator 🗣️🎭

salveenee is a satirical command-line tool that procedurally simulates the rapid, list-style rhetoric associated with Matteo Salvini. It outputs an endless, randomized stream of keywords, places, and social groups rendered as terminal-friendly ASCII art to mimic the "catalogue" delivery often heard in public speeches and short social-media clips. 🎬🕒

## Inspiration 📺
This project was inspired by the Lo‑Fi Goliardica video (used only as inspiration, not part of the project).
